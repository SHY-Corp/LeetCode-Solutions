/*
Finding N Unique Integers Sum Up To Zero-
Given an integer n, return any array containing n unique integers such that they add up to 0.

Problem link- https://leetcode.com/problems/find-n-unique-integers-sum-up-to-zero/

Approach-
Include integers from 1 to n/2 and -1 to -n/2 into the vector
If n is odd, include 0 into the vector as well.
