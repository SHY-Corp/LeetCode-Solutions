Problem 1025 - Divisor Game

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:
    - Choosing any x with 0 < x < N and N % x == 0.
    - Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.
Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.
