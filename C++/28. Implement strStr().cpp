/*Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf(). */

class Solution {
public:
    int strStr(string haystack, string needle) {
        int m = haystack.size(), n = needle.size();
        for (int i = 0; i <= m - n; i++) {
            int j = 0;
            for (; j < n; j++) {
                if (haystack[i + j] != needle[j]) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (j == n) {
                return i;
            }

        return -1;
